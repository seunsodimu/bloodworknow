								<p>We agree with Mayo Medical in saying that laboratory testing plays important role in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. Many people who are already receiving treatment for their medical conditions can use blood testing to monitor the progression or resolution of their conditions.</p>

								<p>In this age and time when many people do not have health insurance, or deductiples are so high our mission is to provide an avenue for affordable blood and laboratory testing. Our clients get their blood tests done at the same reputable and Nationwide laboratories that doctors send their patients.</p>
                            <p>Our aim is to help people who otherwise are unable to afford blood tests or doctor’s visit, to use this avenue to monitor their health, and if any abnormality is detected, we trust they will be encouraged and motivated to go see their medical providers.</p>
